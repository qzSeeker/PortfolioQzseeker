      <p className="tracking-wide mt-8">
        At 19, I'm a self-taught frontend developer from India with a burning
        passion for crafting things for the web. Just three months into a coding
        bootcamp, I realized the magic of building something from scratch.
        Fueled by that excitement, I dove headfirst into self-study alongside my
        computer science degree. Every day brings a new challenge, a new
        project, and a chance to unleash my creativity. For me, coding isn't
        just about the technical aspects; it's about the thrill of
        accomplishment and the endless possibilities for innovation.
